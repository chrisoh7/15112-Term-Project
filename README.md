Jumping to the Moon

Author: Chris Oh (hyunseoo)

Introduction

"Jumping to the Moon" is a game in which the character, Knuckles, has to jump all the way to the moon. In the game, Knuckles is spawned on a map with roaring thunderstorms and randomly generated tiles. The map accurately follows the laws of physics; however, the character can cleverly use physics—drag force and gravity inversion—to jump his way to the moon.
